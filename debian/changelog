  * New GUC extension_destdir: Path to prepend for extension loading

    This directory is prepended to paths when loading extensions (control
    and SQL files), and to the '$libdir' directive when loading modules that
    back functions. The location is made configurable to allow build-time
    testing of extensions that do not have been installed to their proper
    location yet.

    + Set a secure search_path in logical replication walsenders and apply
      workers (Noah Misch)

      A malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database could
      potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role running
      replication, which is often a superuser.  Some of the risks here are
      equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in
      this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute
      with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change
      might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated
      tables' DDL.)  Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that
      belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is
      a hazard to consider. (CVE-2020-14349)

    + Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)

      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried out
      against an extension installation script, if the attacker can create
      objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema of some
      prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require superuser
      privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser
      privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path
      used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within
      the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to help
      third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure.
      This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on other
      extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.

  * New upstream version.
    + Add missing permissions checks for ALTER ... DEPENDS ON EXTENSION.

      Marking an object as dependent on an extension did not have any
      privilege check whatsoever.  This oversight allowed any user to mark
      routines, triggers, materialized views, or indexes as droppable by
      anyone able to drop an extension.  Require that the calling user own the
      specified object (and hence have privilege to drop it). (CVE-2020-1720)
