postgresql-9.1 (9.1.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Require execute permission on the trigger function for "CREATE
      TRIGGER".
      This missing check could allow another user to execute a trigger
      function with forged input data, by installing it on a table he
      owns. This is only of significance for trigger functions marked
      SECURITY DEFINER, since otherwise trigger functions run as the
      table owner anyway. (CVE-2012-0866)
    - Remove arbitrary limitation on length of common name in SSL
      certificates.
      Both libpq and the server truncated the common name extracted from
      an SSL certificate at 32 bytes. Normally this would cause nothing
      worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there are some
      rather-implausible scenarios in which it might allow one
      certificate holder to impersonate another. The victim would have to
      have a common name exactly 32 bytes long, and the attacker would
      have to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the
      common name has that string as a prefix. Impersonating a server
      would also require some additional exploit to redirect client
      connections. (CVE-2012-0867)
    - Convert newlines to spaces in names written in pg_dump comments.
      pg_dump was incautious about sanitizing object names that are
      emitted within SQL comments in its output script. A name containing
      a newline would at least render the script syntactically incorrect.
      Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL injection risk
      when the script is reloaded. (CVE-2012-0868)
    - Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with
      vacuuming.
      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a
      concurrently-running "VACUUM" to miss removing index entries that
      it should remove. After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as "could not
      read block N in file ...") or worse, silently wrong query results
      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table
      locations. This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs
      so infrequently that it was not diagnosed until now. If you have
      reason to suspect that it has happened in your database, reindexing
      the affected index will fix things.
    - Fix transient zeroing of shared buffers during WAL replay.
      The replay logic would sometimes zero and refill a shared buffer,
      so that the contents were transiently invalid. In hot standby mode
      this can result in a query that's executing in parallel seeing
      garbage data. Various symptoms could result from that, but the most
      common one seems to be "invalid memory alloc request size".
    - Fix handling of data-modifying WITH subplans in READ COMMITTED
      rechecking.
      A WITH clause containing "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE" would crash if
      the parent "UPDATE" or "DELETE" command needed to be re-evaluated
      at one or more rows due to concurrent updates in READ COMMITTED
      mode.
    - Fix corner case in SSI transaction cleanup.
      When finishing up a read-write serializable transaction, a crash
      could occur if all remaining active serializable transactions are
      read-only.
    - Fix postmaster to attempt restart after a hot-standby crash.
      A logic error caused the postmaster to terminate, rather than
      attempt to restart the cluster, if any backend process crashed
      while operating in hot standby mode.
    - Fix "CLUSTER"/"VACUUM FULL" handling of toast values owned by
      recently-updated rows.
      This oversight could lead to "duplicate key value violates unique
      constraint" errors being reported against the toast table's index
      during one of these commands.
    - Update per-column permissions, not only per-table permissions, when
      changing table owner.
      Failure to do this meant that any previously granted column
      permissions were still shown as having been granted by the old
      owner. This meant that neither the new owner nor a superuser could
      revoke the now-untraceable-to-table-owner permissions.
    - Support foreign data wrappers and foreign servers in "REASSIGN
      OWNED".
      This command failed with "unexpected classid" errors if it needed
      to change the ownership of any such objects.
    - Allow non-existent values for some settings in "ALTER USER/DATABASE
      SET".
      Allow default_text_search_config, default_tablespace, and
      temp_tablespaces to be set to names that are not known. This is
      because they might be known in another database where the setting
      is intended to be used, or for the tablespace cases because the
      tablespace might not be created yet. The same issue was previously
      recognized for search_path, and these settings now act like that
      one.
    - Fix "unsupported node type" error caused by COLLATE in an "INSERT"
      expression.
    - Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table files
      post-commit.
      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files
      only after the transaction commits. In event of failure then (for
      instance, because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed
      to just emit a warning message and go on, since it's too late to
      abort the transaction. This logic got broken as of release 8.4,
      causing such situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable
      database.
    - Recover from errors occurring during WAL replay of "DROP
      TABLESPACE".
      Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's directories, but
      there are various reasons why this might fail (for example,
      incorrect ownership or permissions on those directories). Formerly
      the replay code would panic, rendering the database unrestartable
      without manual intervention. It seems better to log the problem and
      continue, since the only consequence of failure to remove the
      directories is some wasted disk space.
    - Fix race condition in logging AccessExclusiveLocks for hot standby.
      Sometimes a lock would be logged as being held by "transaction
      zero". This is at least known to produce assertion failures on
      slave servers, and might be the cause of more serious problems.
    - Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even when it
      wraps around.
    - Prevent emitting misleading "consistent recovery state reached" log
      message at the beginning of crash recovery.
    - Fix initial value of pg_stat_replication.replay_location.
    - Fix regular expression back-references with - attached.
      Rather than enforcing an exact string match, the code would
      effectively accept any string that satisfies the pattern
      sub-expression referenced by the back-reference symbol.
      A similar problem still afflicts back-references that are embedded
      in a larger quantified expression, rather than being the immediate
      subject of the quantifier. This will be addressed in a future
      PostgreSQL release.
    - Fix recently-introduced memory leak in processing of inet/cidr
      values.
    - Fix planner's ability to push down index-expression restrictions
      through UNION ALL.
    - Fix planning of WITH clauses referenced in "UPDATE"/"DELETE" on an
      inherited table.
      This bug led to "could not find plan for CTE" failures.
    - Fix GIN cost estimation to handle column IN (...) index conditions.
      This oversight would usually lead to crashes if such a condition
      could be used with a GIN index.
    - Fix dangling pointer after "CREATE TABLE AS"/"SELECT INTO" in a
      SQL-language function.
      In most cases this only led to an assertion failure in
      assert-enabled builds, but worse consequences seem possible.
    - Fix I/O-conversion-related memory leaks in plpgsql.
    - Work around bug in perl's SvPVutf8() function.
      This function crashes when handed a typeglob or certain read-only
      objects such as $^V. Make plperl avoid passing those to it.
    - In pg_dump, don't dump contents of an extension's configuration
      tables if the extension itself is not being dumped.
    - Improve pg_dump's handling of inherited table columns.
      pg_dump mishandled situations where a child column has a different
      default expression than its parent column. If the default is
      textually identical to the parent's default, but not actually the
      same (for instance, because of schema search path differences) it
      would not be recognized as different, so that after dump and
      restore the child would be allowed to inherit the parent's default.
      Child columns that are NOT NULL where their parent is not could
      also be restored subtly incorrectly.
    - Fix pg_restore's direct-to-database mode for INSERT-style table data.
      Direct-to-database restores from archive files made with
      "--inserts" or "--column-inserts" options fail when using
      pg_restore from a release dated September or December 2011, as a
      result of an oversight in a fix for another problem. The archive
      file itself is not at fault, and text-mode output is okay.
    - Teach pg_upgrade to handle renaming of plpython's shared library.
      Upgrading a pre-9.1 database that included plpython would fail
      because of this oversight.
    - Allow pg_upgrade to process tables containing regclass columns.
      Since pg_upgrade now takes care to preserve pg_class OIDs, there
      was no longer any reason for this restriction.
    - Make libpq ignore ENOTDIR errors when looking for an SSL client
      certificate file.
      This allows SSL connections to be established, though without a
      certificate, even when the user's home directory is set to
      something like /dev/null.
    - Fix some more field alignment issues in ecpg's SQLDA area.
    - Allow AT option in ecpg DEALLOCATE statements.
      The infrastructure to support this has been there for awhile, but
      through an oversight there was still an error check rejecting the
      case.
    - Do not use the variable name when defining a varchar structure in
      ecpg.
    - Fix "contrib/auto_explain"'s JSON output mode to produce valid JSON.
    - Fix error in "contrib/intarray"'s int[] & int[] operator.
      If the smallest integer the two input arrays have in common is 1,
      and there are smaller values in either array, then 1 would be
      incorrectly omitted from the result.
    - Fix error detection in "contrib/pgcrypto"'s encrypt_iv() and
      decrypt_iv().
      These functions failed to report certain types of invalid-input
      errors, and would instead return random garbage values for
      incorrect input.
    - Fix one-byte buffer overrun in "contrib/test_parser".
      The code would try to read one more byte than it should, which
      would crash in corner cases. Since "contrib/test_parser" is only
      example code, this is not a security issue in itself, but bad
      example code is still bad.
    - Use __sync_lock_test_and_set() for spinlocks on ARM, if available.
      This function replaces our previous use of the SWPB instruction,
      which is deprecated and not available on ARMv6 and later. Reports
      suggest that the old code doesn't fail in an obvious way on recent
      ARM boards, but simply doesn't interlock concurrent accesses,
      leading to bizarre failures in multiprocess operation.
    - Use "-fexcess-precision=standard" option when building with gcc
      versions that accept it.
      This prevents assorted scenarios wherein recent versions of gcc
      will produce creative results.
    - Allow use of threaded Python on FreeBSD (Chris Rees)
      Our configure script previously believed that this combination
      wouldn't work; but FreeBSD fixed the problem, so remove that error
      check.

postgresql-9.1 (9.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix bugs in information_schema.referential_constraints view.
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint. That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that
      it depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
      Since the view definition is installed by initdb, merely upgrading
      will not fix the problem. If you need to fix this in an existing
      installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the information_schema
      schema then re-create it by sourcing
      "SHAREDIR/information_schema.sql". (Run pg_config --sharedir if
      you're uncertain where "SHAREDIR" is.) This must be repeated in
      each database to be fixed.
    - Make "contrib/citext"'s upgrade script fix collations of citext
      columns and indexes.
      Existing citext columns and indexes aren't correctly marked as
      being of a collatable data type during pg_upgrade from a pre-9.1
      server. That leads to operations on them failing with errors such
      as "could not determine which collation to use for string
      comparison". This change allows them to be fixed by the same script
      that upgrades the citext module into a proper 9.1 extension during
      CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged.
      If you have a previously-upgraded database that is suffering from
      this problem, and you already ran the "CREATE EXTENSION" command,
      you can manually run (as superuser) the "UPDATE" commands found at
      the end of "SHAREDIR/extension/citext--unpackaged--1.0.sql". (Run
      pg_config --sharedir if you're uncertain where "SHAREDIR" is.)
    - Fix possible crash during "UPDATE" or "DELETE" that joins to the
      output of a scalar-returning function.
    - Fix incorrect replay of WAL records for GIN index updates.
    - Fix TOAST-related data corruption during CREATE TABLE dest AS
      SELECT - FROM src or INSERT INTO dest SELECT * FROM src.
    - Fix possible failures during hot standby startup.
    - Start hot standby faster when initial snapshot is incomplete.
    - Fix race condition during toast table access from stale syscache
      entries. The typical symptom was transient errors like "missing chunk
      number 0 for toast value NNNNN in pg_toast_2619", where the cited toast
      table would always belong to a system catalog.
    - Track dependencies of functions on items used in parameter default
      expressions. Previously, a referenced object could be dropped without
      having dropped or modified the function, leading to misbehavior when
      the function was used. Note that merely installing this update will not
      fix the missing dependency entries; to do that, you'd need to
      "CREATE OR REPLACE" each such function afterwards. If you have
      functions whose defaults depend on non-built-in objects, doing so
      is recommended.
    - Fix incorrect management of placeholder variables in nestloop joins.
      This bug is known to lead to "variable not found in subplan target
      list" planner errors, and could possibly result in wrong query
      output when outer joins are involved.
    - Fix window functions that sort by expressions involving aggregates.
    - Fix "MergeAppend child's targetlist doesn't match MergeAppend"
      planner errors.
    - Fix index matching for operators with both collatable and
      noncollatable inputs. In 9.1.0, an indexable operator that has a
      non-collatable left-hand input type and a collatable right-hand input
      type would not be recognized as matching the left-hand column's index.
      An example is the hstore ? text operator.
    - Allow inlining of set-returning SQL functions with multiple OUT
      parameters.
    - Don't trust deferred-unique indexes for join removal.
    - Make DatumGetInetP() unpack inet datums that have a 1-byte header,
      and add a new macro, DatumGetInetPP(), that does not.
    - Improve locale support in money type's input and output.
      Aside from not supporting all standard lc_monetary formatting
      options, the input and output functions were inconsistent, meaning
      there were locales in which dumped money values could not be
      re-read.
    - Don't let transform_null_equals affect CASE foo WHEN NULL ...
      constructs.  transform_null_equals is only supposed to affect foo =
      NULL expressions written directly by the user, not equality checks
      generated internally by this form of CASE.
    - Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys.
    - Fix IF EXISTS to work correctly in "DROP OPERATOR FAMILY".
    - Disallow dropping of an extension from within its own script.
    - Don't mark auto-generated types as extension members.
    - Cope with invalid pre-existing search_path settings during "CREATE
      EXTENSION".
    - Avoid floating-point underflow while tracking buffer allocation
      rate.
    - Prevent autovacuum transactions from running in serializable mode.
      Autovacuum formerly used the cluster-wide default transaction
      isolation level, but there is no need for it to use anything higher
      than READ COMMITTED, and using SERIALIZABLE could result in
      unnecessary delays for other processes.
    - Ensure walsender processes respond promptly to SIGTERM.
    - Exclude "postmaster.opts" from base backups.
    - Fix incorrect field alignment in ecpg's SQLDA area.
    - Preserve blank lines within commands in psql's command history.
      The former behavior could cause problems if an empty line was
      removed from within a string literal, for example.
    - Avoid platform-specific infinite loop in pg_dump.
    - Fix compression of plain-text output format in pg_dump.
      pg_dump has historically understood -Z with no -F switch to mean
      that it should emit a gzip-compressed version of its plain text
      output. Restore that behavior.
    - Fix pg_dump to dump user-defined casts between auto-generated
      types, such as table rowtypes.
    - Fix missed quoting of foreign server names in pg_dump.
    - Assorted fixes for pg_upgrade. Handle exclusion constraints correctly,
      avoid failures on Windows, don't complain about mismatched toast table
      names in 8.4 databases.
    - In PL/pgSQL, allow foreign tables to define row types.
    - Fix up conversions of PL/Perl functions' results.
      Restore the pre-9.1 behavior that PL/Perl functions returning void
      ignore the result value of their last Perl statement; 9.1.0 would
      throw an error if that statement returned a reference. Also, make
      sure it works to return a string value for a composite type, so
      long as the string meets the type's input format. In addition,
      throw errors for attempts to return Perl arrays or hashes when the
      function's declared result type is not an array or composite type,
      respectively. (Pre-9.1 versions rather uselessly returned strings
      like ARRAY(0x221a9a0) or HASH(0x221aa90) in such cases.)
    - Ensure PL/Perl strings are always correctly UTF8-encoded.
    - Use the preferred version of xsubpp to build PL/Perl, not
      necessarily the operating system's main copy.
    - Correctly propagate SQLSTATE in PL/Python exceptions.
    - Do not install PL/Python extension files for Python major versions
      other than the one built against.
    - Change all the "contrib" extension script files to report a useful
      error message if they are fed to psql. This should help teach people
      about the new method of using "CREATE EXTENSION" to load these files.
      In most cases, sourcing the scripts directly would fail anyway, but
      with harder-to-interpret messages.
    - Fix incorrect coding in "contrib/dict_int" and "contrib/dict_xsyn".
    - Remove "contrib/sepgsql" tests from the regular regression test
      mechanism. Since these tests require root privileges for setup, they're
      impractical to run automatically. Switch over to a manual approach
      instead, and provide a testing script to help with that.
    - Fix assorted errors in "contrib/unaccent"'s configuration file
      parsing.
    - Honor query cancel interrupts promptly in pgstatindex().
    - Revert unintentional enabling of WAL_DEBUG. Fortunately, as debugging
      tools go, this one is pretty cheap; but it's not intended to be enabled
      by default, so revert.
    - Ensure VPATH builds properly install all server header files.
    - Shorten file names reported in verbose error messages.
      Regular builds have always reported just the name of the C file
      containing the error message call, but VPATH builds formerly
      reported an absolute path name.

postgresql-9.1 (9.1~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    most probably be the version supported in the Wheezy release.

  * debian/control: Suggest locales-all. (Closes: #629875)

postgresql-9.1 (9.1~beta3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
    - Works around gcc 4.6.0 bug. (Closes: #633086)

    Note that this does not change the data format since Beta 2, so no need
    to dump/reload clusters.

  * debian/control: Fix the server-dev dependency to p-common to also work for
    backports.
  * debian/watch: Fix for beta versions.
  * debian/copyright: Add pointers to GPL and Artistic licenses for the Perl
    terms.
  * debian/postgresql-9.1.preinst: Fail the package upgrade early when
    upgrading from beta-1, as the DB format changed.

postgresql-9.1 (9.1~beta1-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add postgresql-common dependency to -server-dev, so that
    we get the pg_config diversion.
  * 52-tutorial-README.patch: Fix server-dev version in comment.
  * 51-default-sockets-in-var.patch: Move the pg_regress patching parts to
    debian/pg_regress-in-tmp.patch and temporarily apply it only for running
    the local checks. In the installed system it seems we actually do want it
    to use the /var/run/postgresql socket dir. (Closes: #554166)

    noticing.

    patch! (Closes: #627597)
